# Measures of Central Tendency

Central tendency is a fundamental concept in statistics that helps us understand and summarize data distributions. It identifies the "center" or typical value around which a dataset tends to cluster. This concept is crucial for navigating through data and finding the most representative value.

## Overview of Main Measures

There are three primary measures of central tendency: mean, median, and mode. Each measure offers a different perspective on the center of a distribution and is useful in different scenarios.

1. **Mean:** The mean, also known as the arithmetic average, is calculated by summing up all the values in a dataset and dividing by the total number of values. It represents a balanced center that considers every data point. However, extreme values can significantly influence the mean and skew its representation.

2. **Median:** The median is the middle value of a dataset when it is arranged in ascending or descending order. It is less affected by outliers compared to the mean, making it a robust measure of central tendency. The median is particularly useful when a distribution is skewed or contains outliers.

3. **Mode:** The mode refers to the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. Unlike the mean and median, which focus on numerical values, the mode provides insight into the most common category or class in categorical data. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or more (multimodal).
